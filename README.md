This project is a part of the astronomy-course AST2000 at the University of Oslo. The course gives an introduction to important topics in astrophysics, from orbital calculations to stellar 
evolution and the theory of relativity. The project is divided into seven parts. In the first few parts we are modelling a simplified rocket-engine. We then use the simulated performance of 
the engine to simulate launch from a planet in a given randomly generated solar-system. While coasting through the solar-system we orient our space-craft using image-recognizion software we
develop, as well as other naccessary navigation software. We simulate the trajectory of the spacecraft using Newtons gravitational law to calculate the gravitational pull from the sun and all
planets. We then try to land on the planet of our choise by simulating the landing: taking into account the gravitation of the planet aswell as the effects of the atmosphere that we modell. 
We analysed the spectrallines of the atmosphere of our planet in order to determine the composition of the atmosphere. In order to do this we had to do some signal prosessing. Finally we also 
analyzed the light emitted from our star in order to determine the expected lifetime of the star.

The project spans over the entire semester and amounts to a report of the different parts in the project. In this repository you will find all the code we developed to solve the different
challanges. Note that the entire project is based on a fictive, simplified solarsystem.
